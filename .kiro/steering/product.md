# Product Overview

## Symphony IDE

Symphony is an AI-First Development Environment (AIDE) that places intelligent orchestration at its core. Unlike traditional IDEs that treat AI as an add-on, Symphony is built from the ground up for AI collaboration.

### Core Philosophy

**Minimal Core, Maximum Potential** - Symphony ships with only essential components:
- **Text Editor** (built on XI-editor foundation)
- File Explorer  
- Syntax Highlighting (via XI-editor's Syntect)
- Terminal Integration
- Extension System

Everything else comes from the community through extensions.

### Architecture Foundation

Symphony is built on a **two-layer architecture**:

1. **XI-editor Foundation** - Battle-tested text editing core
   - Rope data structure for efficient text manipulation
   - JSON-RPC communication protocol
   - LSP (Language Server Protocol) support
   - Plugin infrastructure
   - Syntax highlighting via TextMate grammars
   
2. **Symphony AIDE Layer** - Built from scratch
   - AI orchestration and intelligent workflows
   - The Conductor (microkernel orchestrator)
   - Agent coordination and management
   - Artifact-based communication
   - Extension ecosystem (Instruments, Operators, Motifs)

### Key Innovations

- **The Conductor**: Microkernel orchestrator that manages AI agents and workflows
- **Agent-Driven Development (ADD)**: Specialized AI agents coordinate like a team to build software
- **Three-Layer Extension System**: Instruments (AI models), Operators (utilities), Motifs (UI enhancements)
- **Artifact-Based Communication**: Models exchange structured outputs for transparency
- **XI-editor Foundation**: Proven, high-performance text editing instead of building from scratch

### Target Users

- Individual developers seeking AI-powered productivity
- Development teams wanting consistent, reproducible workflows  
- Organizations building custom AI capabilities for competitive advantage

### Vision

Transform software creation from linear coding to intelligent orchestration, where humans compose systems and AI handles implementation complexity - all built on a solid, proven text editing foundation.
