# Product Overview

## Symphony IDE

Symphony is an AI-First Development Environment (AIDE) that places intelligent orchestration at its core. Unlike traditional IDEs that treat AI as an add-on, Symphony is built from the ground up for AI collaboration.

### Core Philosophy

**Minimal Core, Maximum Potential** - Symphony ships with only essential components:
- Text Editor
- File Explorer  
- Syntax Highlighting
- Terminal Integration
- Extension System

Everything else comes from the community through extensions.

### Key Innovations

- **The Conductor**: Microkernel orchestrator that manages AI agents and workflows
- **Agent-Driven Development (ADD)**: Specialized AI agents coordinate like a team to build software
- **Three-Layer Extension System**: Instruments (AI models), Operators (utilities), Addons (UI enhancements)
- **Artifact-Based Communication**: Models exchange structured outputs for transparency

### Target Users

- Individual developers seeking AI-powered productivity
- Development teams wanting consistent, reproducible workflows  
- Organizations building custom AI capabilities for competitive advantage

### Vision

Transform software creation from linear coding to intelligent orchestration, where humans compose systems and AI handles implementation complexity.
