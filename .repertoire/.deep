## Status Tracking System
- [ ] → Idle (not started)
- [ - ] → In Progress (actively being worked on)
- [ 1 ] → Completed successfully (first attempt)
- [ 2 ] → Completed after 1 reopening
- [ 3+ ] → Completed after multiple reopenings

## Milestone Naming Convention
- M{N} → Level 0 (Strategic milestone, e.g., M1)
- M{N.X} → Level 1 (Section X of milestone N, e.g., M1.1)
- M{N.X.Y} → Level 2 (Step Y of section X, e.g., M1.1.1)
- F{XXX} → Features mapped from Level 2 steps

## BIF Integration
- 8-Dimension Evaluation: Feature Completeness, Code Quality, Documentation, Reliability, Performance, Integration, Maintenance, Stress Collapse Estimation
- Atomic Feature Identification: Line-by-line analysis of implemented features
- Production Readiness Assessment: Comprehensive quality validation before deployment
