# Level 2 M3 Notes: The Pit - Infrastructure Extensions Decisions and Insights

> **Purpose**: Incremental decision and insight tracking for M3 Infrastructure Extensions implementation

**Parent**: Level 1 M3 The Pit  
**Status**: Empty by default - filled incrementally as decisions, issues, or insights emerge during development

## 📝 Decision Log

### December 27, 2025: Four-File Architecture Migration
**Decision**: Migrated Level 2 M3 from single LEVEL2_M3.md to four-file structure
**Rationale**: Separation of concerns - ATDD requirements, technical design, implementation guidemap, and incremental notes
**Files Created**:
- `requirements.md` - ATDD acceptance criteria and Gherkin scenarios
- `design.md` - Technical architecture, crate structures, and performance targets
- `LEVEL2_M3.md` - Implementation guidemap with task breakdowns and checkboxes
- `notes.md` - Incremental decision and insight tracking (this file)

**Content Distribution**:
- High-level architecture diagrams → `design.md`
- Acceptance criteria and glossary → `requirements.md`
- Task breakdowns with `[ ]` checkboxes → `LEVEL2_M3.md`
- Performance targets table → `design.md`
- Testing strategy → `design.md`
