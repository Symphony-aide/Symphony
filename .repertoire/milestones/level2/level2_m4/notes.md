# Level 2 M4 Notes: Extension Ecosystem Decisions and Insights

> **Purpose**: Incremental decision and insight tracking for M4 Extension Ecosystem implementation

**Parent**: Level 1 M4 Extension Ecosystem  
**Status**: Empty by default - filled incrementally as decisions, issues, or insights emerge during development

## 📝 Decision Log

### December 27, 2025: Four-File Architecture Migration
**Decision**: Migrated Level 2 M4 from single LEVEL2_M4.md to four-file structure
**Rationale**: Separation of concerns - ATDD requirements, technical design, implementation guidemap, and incremental notes
**Files Created**:
- `requirements.md` - ATDD acceptance criteria and Gherkin scenarios
- `design.md` - Technical architecture, crate structures, and security architecture
- `LEVEL2_M4.md` - Implementation guidemap with task breakdowns and checkboxes
- `notes.md` - Incremental decision and insight tracking (this file)

**Content Distribution**:
- High-level architecture diagrams → `design.md`
- Acceptance criteria and glossary → `requirements.md`
- Task breakdowns with `[ ]` checkboxes → `LEVEL2_M4.md`
- Security architecture → `design.md`
- Platform-specific implementations table → `design.md`
- Integration points → `design.md`
