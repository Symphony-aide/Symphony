# Symphony IDE

> 🎼 AI-First Development Environment
> 

## 🎯 Overview

Symphony is a minimal, extensible IDE designed around intelligent orchestration. Unlike traditional IDEs that treat AI as an add-on, Symphony places AI collaboration at its core through an innovative agent-driven architecture.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy

**Minimal Core, Maximum Potential** - Symphony ships with only essential components:

- 📝 Text Editor
- 🗂️ File Explorer
- 🎨 Syntax Highlighting
- 💻 Terminal Integration
- 🔌 Extension System

Everything else—debugging, language servers, AI models, specialized tools—comes from the community through extensions.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎼 Intelligent Orchestration

- **🎩 The Conductor**: Orchestrates complex workflows using specialized AI agents
- **🤖 Agent-Driven Development**: AI handles implementation while you guide the vision
- **🎛️ Visual Workflows**: Compose development processes through intuitive interfaces

### 🎭 Three-Layer Extension System

- **🎻 Instruments**: AI/ML models as configurable extensions
- **⚙️ Operators**: Workflow utilities and data processing tools
- **🧩 Addons**: UI enhancements and specialized editors

### Developer Experience

- Lightning-fast startup times
- Community-driven intelligence
- Transparent, artifact-based communication
- Secure sandboxed execution

## Architecture

Symphony uses a microkernel architecture where the minimal core orchestrates an ecosystem of intelligent extensions. This design ensures:

- **Reliability**: Component failures don't crash the system
- **Flexibility**: Unlimited customization through extensions
- **Performance**: Load only what you need
- **Security**: Controlled permissions and sandboxing

## Getting Started

1. Download Symphony core
2. Browse the Orchestra Kit marketplace
3. Install extensions for your tech stack
4. Configure your development workflow
5. Let AI agents handle the complexity

## Extension Development

Symphony's open ecosystem welcomes contributions:

- **Full ownership** of your extensions
- **Flexible licensing** - choose your business model
- **Secure sandboxing** with defined permissions
- **Global distribution** through the marketplace

## Use Cases

Symphony adapts to diverse development scenarios:

- Rapid prototyping with AI assistance
- Complex enterprise applications
- Research and experimental projects
- Team collaboration with shared workflows

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: Proprietary (ensures quality and security)
- **Extensions**: Any technology stack
- **Communication**: Structured artifacts and APIs
- **Deployment**: Cross-platform desktop application

## Community

Join developers building the future of AI-assisted development:

- Contribute extensions to the marketplace
- Share workflows and best practices
- Collaborate on open-source tools
- Shape the evolution of intelligent development

## Vision

Symphony represents a paradigm shift from tool-assisted to agent-orchestrated development. We envision a future where developers compose intelligent systems rather than write individual lines of code.
