# Git Strategy

This document outlines the branching and contribution strategy for the development of the **Agentic Symphony IDE**. Our goal is to maintain a clean, scalable, and collaborative codebase as we build a fully agent-driven development environment.

---

## 🏩️ Branch Structure

### `main` — 🟢 **Stable Release Branch**

- Contains **production-ready**, thoroughly tested code.
- Direct pushes to this branch are **prohibited**.
- Only the `holder` branch can be merged into `main` via Pull Request (PR) after a final review or release milestone.

### `holder` — 🟡 **Integration / Pre-Merge Branch**

- Serves as an **upstream integration hub** for all features, bug fixes, and refactor efforts.
- All development branches must merge into `holder` via PRs.
- `holder` is the **only branch allowed to merge into `main`**.

---

## 🌱 Development Branch Naming Conventions

All work must be done on **sub-branches** off of `holder`. Use the following naming patterns for clarity and consistency:

| Branch Type | Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature | `feat/<feature-name>` | Adds a new feature |
| Bug Fix | `fix/<issue-name>` | Fixes a specific bug or issue |
| Refactoring | `refactor/<module-or-scope>` | Code cleanup, structure improvement |
| Documentation | `docs/<section>` | Changes to documentation |
| Chore | `chore/<task-name>` | Routine tasks (e.g., config, setup) |
| Experiment | `exp/<idea-or-model>` | Prototypes, proof-of-concepts |

### 🔀 Example:

- `feat/prompt-enhancer`
- `fix/null-response-in-editor`
- `refactor/conductor-orchestration`
- `docs/git-strategy`
- `chore/setup-poetry`
- `exp/agent-auto-debugger`

## 🔧 Development Flow

1. **Checkout from `holder`**:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout holder
    git pull origin holder
    git checkout -b feat/agentic-planner
    
    ```
    
2. **Push changes to your branch**:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: implement planner agent logic"
    git push origin feat/agentic-planner
    
    ```
    
3. **Open a Pull Request into `holder`**:
    - Title: `feat: implement planner agent logic`
    - Reviewer must approve.
    - CI checks must pass.
4. **Holder to Main Merge** (done by maintainers):
    - Only after QA, testing, and milestone completion.

---

## 🛠️ Branch Hygiene & Best Practices

- **Rebase frequently** from `holder` to stay updated.
- Keep PRs **small and focused**.
- Link PRs to issues (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- Write meaningful commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Avoid pushing directly to `holder` or `main`.

## 🛡️ Access Control

- `main`: protected, maintainers-only merges
- `holder`: protected, PRs only
- `feat/*`, `fix/*`, etc.: developer branches, PR required
