## ✨ Overview

Symphony's modes are designed with usability and power in mind. Instead of overwhelming you with technical options, Symphony provides **three themed entry points**:

| Mode | Icon | Ideal For | Models Involved |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Maestro** | 🎶 | Full app creation from a single prompt | Full orchestration (all models) |
| **Virtuoso** | 🎻 | Editing, refactoring, or enhancing code | Editor-centric, context-sensitive |
| **Solo** | 🎧 | Quick help, questions, or snippets | Lightweight LLM/Enhancer only |

Each mode routes user input through a curated sequence of intelligent agents that optimize time, accuracy, and usefulness.

## 🎶 Maestro Mode (Full Orchestra)

> “Compose a complete masterpiece from a single idea.”
> 

Maestro Mode is the heart of Symphony's vision. Just like a conductor guiding an orchestra, this mode uses the entire model suite to transform a high-level prompt into a fully working project.

**Use this mode when you want to:**

- Generate a new project from scratch
- Explore architectural ideas with working code
- Experiment with full feature sets

**Behind the scenes:**

- 🎤 Enhancer-Prompt Model: Enhances your raw prompt into a technical blueprint
- 🎼 Feature Model: Breaks down functionality into epics and tasks
- 🏠 Planner Model: Designs architecture and dependencies
- 🔹 Coordinator Model: Sequences tasks and strategies
- 🔢 Code-Visualizer Model: Translates logic into pseudocode
- 👨‍💻 Editor Model: Generates actual code files
- 🧹 Conductor Model: Oversees the orchestration

**Example prompt:**

> "Build a task management app with user accounts and email reminders"
> 

Maestro mode outputs:

- Full GitHub-ready codebase
- `backlog.csv`, `plan.json`, `instructions.json`
- Beautifully documented `README.md`

## 🎻 Virtuoso Mode (Smart Editing)

> “Make brilliant improvements with surgical precision.”
> 

Virtuoso Mode is designed for developers who already have code and want to **edit**, **extend**, or **refactor** efficiently.

**Use this mode when you want to:**

- Add a feature to an existing project
- Refactor or clean up code
- Generate test cases or documentation

**How it works:**

Virtuoso smartly selects an internal workflow based on what you need. It can:

- Use the **Editor Model** for direct edits
- Invoke the **Enhancer + Feature** models for new features
- Automatically refactor or document code snippets

**Examples:**

- "Refactor this function to follow clean architecture"
- "Add JWT authentication to this FastAPI route"
- "Generate tests for `utils.py`"

**Virtuoso gives you professional assistance without the full orchestration overhead.**

---

## 🎧 Solo Mode (Ask & Generate)

> “Sometimes, you just need a quick note or solo performance.”
> 

Solo Mode is Symphony's lightweight interaction mode. Perfect for quick tasks, explanations, and minor code generation.

**Use this mode when you want to:**

- Ask about a Python concept
- Generate a one-off function or snippet
- Get quick guidance or syntax reminders

**Powering this mode:**

- 🎤 Enhancer or small LLM agent
- No orchestration, no coordination

**Examples:**

- "What's the difference between `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`?"
- "Generate a regex to match an email address"

**Solo Mode keeps things simple and fast.**

---

## 🤝 How Modes Work Together

While modes are distinct, they complement one another:

- Start in **Solo Mode** to explore an idea, then switch to **Virtuoso** to implement it.
- Use **Virtuoso** to improve code generated by **Maestro**.
- Think of them as layers of support: Solo → Virtuoso → Maestro.

You can switch modes at any time from the UI or command palette.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will Virtuoso overwrite my code?**

Only if you allow it. All changes are previewed before saving.

**Q: Do I need an internet connection?**

Yes, Symphony relies on cloud-based AI orchestration for Maestro and Virtuoso modes.
