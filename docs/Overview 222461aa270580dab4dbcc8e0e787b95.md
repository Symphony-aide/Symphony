# Overview

This document explains how the Notion workspace is organized for managing the Agentic Symphony IDE development. It defines the purpose and relationship between different pages/databases used to plan, build, and track the system efficiently.

---

## 📘 Engineering Docs Page

### Purpose:

This page houses long-form documents like PRDs (Product Requirements Documents), architecture notes, model specifications, and orchestration flow explanations.

### Typical Contents:

- Feature specs (e.g., Planner model behavior)
- Output format documentation (e.g., plan.json, backlog.csv)
- Design decisions
- Diagrams (via embeds or image uploads)
- Prompt structures and usage examples

### Use Case:

Used by developers and orchestrators to understand how each model/component works, how they interact, and how to implement new features.

---

## 📥 Feature Requests Page

### Purpose:

This is a structured board/database where **new feature ideas** are collected, tracked, reviewed, and prioritized.

### Status Workflow:

- `New`: Raw idea, not yet reviewed
- `Under Review`: Being evaluated for value, feasibility, and alignment
- `Planned`: Accepted and ready for future development
- `In Development`: Currently being worked on
- `Launched`: Completed and released
- `Declined`: Intentionally rejected after review

### Use Case:

This page is used by product owners and the team to track both user-facing and internal system features (e.g., “Planner model outputs plan.json”). Each feature may link to relevant PRDs, tasks, and issues.

---

## 🐛 Issue Tracking Page

### Purpose:

Used to log, manage, and resolve **specific problems**, bugs, or smaller units of work that do not qualify as full features.

### Status Workflow:

- `Backlog`: A known issue that hasn't been scheduled
- `Open`: Ready to be picked up
- `In Progress`: Actively being worked on
- `In Review`: Awaiting code or design review
- `Testing`: Under testing/validation
- `Resolved`: Verified and closed
- `Won't Fix`: Intentionally left unresolved (e.g., edge case, too expensive, obsolete)

### Use Case:

Track and resolve individual bugs or technical issues. Some may be linked to features or projects.

---

## ✅ Task Tracker Page

### Purpose:

This page stores **concrete, actionable tasks** assigned to individuals. Tasks are typically linked to a project area.

---

## 🔗 Relationships Between Pages

- **Features** are born in the **Feature Requests page** and detailed in the **Engineering Docs**.
- Once approved, they are broken into **Stories** and **Tasks** inside the **Task Tracker**.
- Any bugs or follow-up issues related to a feature go into the **Issue Tracking page**.
- All of these may link to or be grouped under a parent **Project** (optional Project DB).

---

## 📎 Notes:

- Internal system behaviors (e.g., a model generating an internal file) are still considered features if they are intentional and testable.
- Adding simple debug statements is **not a feature** but may be a task or sub-task.
- Bugs that won’t be addressed should be clearly marked `Won’t Fix` with a reason.
- You can rename `Backlog` to `TODO` or other terms that better reflect your team's workflow.
