## 🎯 Understanding Kernel Architectures

In Symphony's world, the **kernel architecture** determines how the **Conductor Core** interacts with the various components of the system. Just like operating system kernels, different approaches offer distinct trade-offs between performance, security, modularity, and complexity.

The choice of kernel architecture fundamentally shapes how **AI agents**, **workflow management**, and Assembling **systems [Extension system]** collaborate to create your development symphony.
