## 🎮 What is Function Quest?

**Function Quest** is a logic-based puzzle game where players solve levels by reading a narrative story and deducing a sequence of function calls that will achieve a specified goal. Unlike traditional coding games, Function Quest is not about writing or executing code — it's about understanding and reasoning with a list of named functions.

Each level presents a short story ("problem statement") and a list of available functions. These functions are described by their names, purposes, and return values. Players must analyze the story, mentally simulate the effects of functions, and logically determine the correct chain of calls needed to win.

---

## 🎯 Game Objective

Your objective in each level is to use the available functions in the correct order (with the right parameters) to achieve the level's stated goal — such as unlocking a door, escaping a room, or solving a mechanical puzzle.

Each function has a predictable effect, and there's always a single or minimal path to the goal, which the player must deduce.

---

## 🧠 Game Rules

1. **Fixed Function Set**: Each level gives you a curated list of functions. These are your only tools.
2. **No Guesswork**: The logic is fully deductible from names, descriptions, return values, and story context.
3. **Logical Sequencing**: The correct sequence must match the narrative's implied logic.
4. **Repetition Allowed**: You may call functions more than once unless a specific constraint forbids it.
5. **Winning**: You win a level when your final function returns the target success value (e.g., `"The door opens!"`).

## 🧾 Narrative-Based Problem Statements

Every level begins with a short passage written in natural language. These **Problem Statements** describe a scene or action sequence that hides a logical structure the player must uncover.

These narratives:

- Define the level's **goal** implicitly or explicitly.
- Use verbs and structure to suggest **action sequences**.
- Include clues for necessary objects, transformations, or conditions.
- Avoid directly referencing function names — players must infer.

### Example:

> John is afraid of ghosts, but he has to reach his apartment.
> 
> 
> He strolls slowly and looks around for any ghosts. If he sees one, he will yell.
> 
> When he reaches his door, he searches his pockets, finds his key, and quickly unlocks the door. He rushes inside, safe and sound.
> 

### Implied Action Chain:

- `look_around()`
- `find_key()`
- `use_key('rusty_key')`
- `open_door()`

## 🗺 Level Design Framework

Each level is constructed using three components:

1. **Problem Statement** (Narrative)
2. **Function List**
3. **Win Condition**

### Function Format:

Each function is presented as:

- `function_name(params)`
- **Description**: One-sentence behavior description
- **Return Value**: What the function gives back

### Example Function Table:

| # | Function Name | Description | Return Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `check_door()` | Checks the current status of the door | `'locked'` or `'unlocked'` |
| 2 | `look_around()` | Observes your surroundings | `'There is dust in the corner.'` |
| 3 | `find_key()` | Searches for a key nearby | `'rusty_key'` |
| 4 | `inspect_floor()` | Examines the floor | `'key_fragment'` |
| 5 | `combine_items(a,b)` | Combines two inventory items | `'complete_key'` |
| 6 | `use_key(item)` | Attempts to unlock the door with item | `'Success!'` or `'Nothing happens.'` |
| 7 | `open_door()` | Attempts to open the door | `'Locked.'` or `'The door opens!'` |
| 8 | `inventory()` | Lists items currently held | List of strings |

### Example Solution Path:

1. `look_around()`
2. `inspect_floor()` → `'key_fragment'`
3. `find_key()` → `'rusty_key'`
4. `combine_items('rusty_key', 'key_fragment')` → `'complete_key'`
5. `use_key('complete_key')`
6. `open_door()` → `'The door opens!'`

---

## 🰇 Multi-Challenge Levels

A single level may consist of **multiple sequential challenges**, each of which is a puzzle in itself. For example, **Level 1 may contain 11 different challenges**, each building upon the previous or offering a unique variation of the core logic.

This structure avoids rapid or shallow level transitions and supports **fair gamification** by giving players room to deeply explore the mechanics before progressing.

---

## ⭐ Optional Functions & Scoring

Some functions are **optional** — they aren't required to win the level but may:

- Improve the **safety** of the solution (e.g. confirming a condition first)
- Increase the **output score** for the level/challenge

### Example:

Using `check_door()` before `open_door()` is not required if you already know the door is unlocked. However, calling it ensures your logic is safe and complete, earning a higher score.

> Note: Players will not be told which functions are optional. Not all levels have optional functions, and identifying their usefulness is part of the puzzle.

## 💪 Level Progression & Complexity

Each level increases in complexity across multiple dimensions. Here's how levels can evolve:

### 🔄 Progression Axes

| Axis | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ➕ **More Functions** | More available functions to choose from. |
| ⛔ **Usage Limits** | You may only call a set number of functions in a level. |
| 🔁 **No Repeats** | Disallow calling the same function more than once. |
| 🧠 **Smarter Paths** | Solutions require transforming or combining intermediate results. |
| 🔍 **Clue Complexity** | More abstract narratives or misleading wording. |
| 🏗️ **Multi-Phase Goals** | First build, then activate, then escape. |
| 🎯 **Exact Steps** | Solve in exactly N or fewer steps. |

---

## 🎭 Narrative Styles

To keep the game engaging and varied, problem statements may be written in different tones:

| Style | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🕵️ Detective | Clues and observations | "A smudge near the painting. A hidden tile below." |
| 🎮 Cinematic | Dramatic sequences and suspense | "She pressed the final button as the timer hit zero." |
| 🧙 Fantasy | Magic, rituals, ancient machinery | "The runes glow only when paired with the ancient blade." |
| 🤡 Humorous | Silly, comedic twists | "The robot needs a sandwich to grant access." |
| 🗱 Realistic | Everyday logic and situations | "You forgot your keys again. But wait—did you leave a spare under the mat?" |

## 📌 Summary

**Function Quest** is a reasoning game disguised as a coding puzzle. It rewards logical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to convert abstract language into structured logic.

- 🎯 Each level has a clear goal
- 🛠️ You get a list of available tools (functions)
- 📖 You read a story that subtly reveals what to do
- 🧠 You plan the right steps — no guessing, no randomness

Every function is intentional. Every sentence in the narrative is a clue. And every level is a carefully designed puzzle that you solve with your mind.
