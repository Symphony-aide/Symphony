# Virtuoso Mode

Welcome to **Virtuoso Mode**, the intelligent assistant for developers who want to **improve, extend, and maintain code with precision**. Just like a virtuoso musician, this mode is designed for finesse, speed, and expert-level adaptability.

Whether you're adding a feature, writing tests, or restructuring a complex module, **Virtuoso Mode dynamically understands your intention and activates only the necessary agents** — saving you time, context switches, and mental overhead.

## 🎻 What is Virtuoso Mode?

Virtuoso Mode is one of the three core operational modes of **Symphony IDE**, focused on:

- **Editing** existing code intelligently
- **Enhancing** code with features, tests, or docs
- **Maintaining** architectural consistency

Unlike Maestro Mode (which generates full apps), Virtuoso works **within your existing project** — making smart decisions based on the file, code, and your intention.

---

## 🧠 Smart Intent Recognition

Virtuoso Mode begins by analyzing your prompt or interaction. It determines **what you want to do**, using a lightweight **Intent Classifier** (powered by the Enhancer Model).

### Supported Intents:

- `feature-addition`: Add new functionality
- `refactor-request`: Improve or restructure code
- `test-generation`: Generate unit/integration tests
- `doc-generation`: Write or update documentation
- `bug-fix`: Modify existing logic for correctness
- `file-edit`: Edit a specific file directly

Example:

> User input: "Add Google OAuth login support"
> 
> 
> **Detected intent:** `feature-addition`
> 

---

## 🎓 Dynamic Model Activation

Once the intent is recognized, Virtuoso activates only the models needed:

| Intent | Activated Models |
| --- | --- |
| `feature-addition` | Enhancer → Feature → Editor |
| `test-generation` | Editor (in test-gen mode) |
| `refactor-request` | Editor (in refactor mode) |
| `doc-generation` | Editor (in doc-gen mode) |
| `bug-fix` | Editor (with contextual diff awareness) |
| `file-edit` | Editor (manual instruction) |

This smart routing prevents unnecessary steps and keeps Virtuoso fast and efficient.

## 🧹 Internal Operation Flows

Here's how Virtuoso handles an example task from start to finish:

### Example: Add a New Feature

1. 🎤 **Enhancer**: Expands "Add JWT auth" to full technical spec.
2. 🎼 **Feature Model**: Breaks down into actionable subtasks.
3. 👨‍💻 **Editor**: Implements the subtasks into the target codebase.

### Example: Refactor Existing Code

1. 👨‍💻 **Editor**: Uses in-file analysis to restructure logic while preserving functionality.

All operations are **non-destructive by default** — changes are previewed before being saved.

---

## 🌐 Examples & Use Cases

### ✏️ Refactoring

> "Refactor UserService to separate concerns and remove inline SQL"
> 
- Editor reads file, restructures it using Repository pattern

### ➕ Adding a Feature

> "Add email notification after task creation"
> 
- Enhancer → Feature → Editor generate service, integration, and minimal tests

### ✏️ Writing Tests

> "Write unit tests for invoice.py"
> 
- Editor detects functions/classes and generates pytest-compatible tests

### 📃 Generating Docs

> "Add docstrings to all public functions in parser.py"
> 
- Editor processes file and inserts/update Google-style docstrings

## ✨ Benefits of Virtuoso Mode

- ⏱ **Speed**: No orchestration overhead, fast local responses
- 🧬 **Precision**: Focuses only on what you need
- 🛠️ **Safe**: Changes reviewed before applying
- 🤝 **Flexible**: Works across different codebases and languages
- 🌍 **Scalable**: More smart flows can be added incrementally

---

## 👨‍💼 Developer Notes & Extensibility

Virtuoso Mode is designed to be easily extended:

- Add new `intent types` and map them to custom flows
- Modify the `classifier thresholds` for intent recognition
- Support new file types (e.g., Java, Go) by extending the Editor Model

**Future roadmap includes:**

- Dependency-aware editing
- Project-wide refactoring suggestions
- Lint/format integration
