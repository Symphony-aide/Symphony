# Symphony Backend Packages Reference

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09  
**Purpose**: Concise reference for all Symphony backend packages

---

## Part I: Core Foundation

### 1. `core`

**Path**: `apps/backend/core/`  
**Package**: `sveditor-core` v0.1.7

**Why We Need It**: Foundation for the entire backend - provides the server infrastructure that hosts all other components.

**Responsibilities**:
- Run JSON-RPC server for frontend communication
- Manage multiple editor states
- Handle HTTP and local transport protocols
- Coordinate extension system
- Serve as embedding host for Python Conductor

**Idea & Behavior**: Originally from Graviton fork, being transformed into Symphony's orchestration host. Will embed Python interpreter to run Conductor, initialize Pit extensions in-process, and coordinate all backend operations. Acts as the "stage" where the Conductor performs.

---

### 2. `types`

**Path**: `apps/backend/types/`  
**Package**: `sytypes` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Single source of truth for all data structures - prevents type mismatches and enables compile-time safety across 40+ packages.

**Role**: Central type repository providing shared types, traits, and data structures used by every package in the backend.

**Responsibilities**:
- Define workflow types (WorkflowNode, WorkflowGraph, DAG structures)
- Define artifact types (Artifact, ArtifactMetadata, quality scores)
- Define extension types (ExtensionManifest, PermissionSet)
- Define IPC message types for communication
- Define error types for unified error handling
- Provide serde-compatible types for serialization

**Idea & Behavior**: Zero-cost abstractions - all types compile away with no runtime overhead. Every package depends on this, making it the foundation of type safety. Uses Rust's type system to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

---

### 3. `config`

**Path**: `apps/backend/config/`

### 41. `permissions`

**Path**: `apps/backend/permissions/`  
**Package**: `sy-permissions` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Global permission system for all components - ensures consistent security policy.

**Role**: System-wide permission management.

**Responsibilities**:
- Define global permission model
- Enforce permissions across all components
- Provide permission checking API
- Support role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit permission checks
- Handle permission inheritance

**Idea & Behavior**: Centralized authorization - all permission checks go through this. RBAC enables flexible policies. Audit trail for compliance.

### 42. `logging`

**Path**: `apps/backend/logging/`  
**Package**: `sy-logging` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: 40+ packages generating logs - need centralized, structured logging for debugging and monitoring.

**Role**: Centralized logging and tracing infrastructure.

**Responsibilities**:
- Collect logs from all packages
- Provide structured logging (JSON)
- Support multiple log levels
- Export to files and external systems
- Enable distributed tracing
- Provide log aggregation

**Idea & Behavior**: Structured logging with tracing - uses tracing crate for spans and events. JSON output for machine parsing. Distributed tracing tracks requests across components.

### 43. `hooks`

**Path**: `apps/backend/hooks/`  
**Package**: `sy-hooks` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Desktop app needs OS integration (notifications, file associations, protocol handlers) - hooks provide this.

**Role**: Desktop integration hooks for OS-level features.

**Responsibilities**:
- Handle desktop notifications
- Register file associations
- Register protocol handlers (symphony://)
- Integrate with system tray
- Handle deep links
- Provide OS-specific integrations

**Idea & Behavior**: Platform-specific integrations - uses Tauri APIs for desktop features. Enables "Open with Symphony" and symphony:// URLs. System tray for background operation.

## Part XI: Applications

### 44. `desktop`

**Path**: `apps/backend/desktop/`  
**Package**: `sy-desktop` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Primary deployment target - most users run Symphony as desktop app.

**Role**: Tauri desktop application wrapping Symphony backend and React frontend.

**Responsibilities**:
- Embed Symphony backend (core + Conductor + Pit)
- Host React frontend in webview
- Provide native window management
- Handle OS integration
- Manage application lifecycle
- Provide Tauri commands for frontend

**Idea & Behavior**: Native desktop app - Tauri provides native window with embedded webview. Backend runs in-process. Smaller than Electron, better performance. Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

---

### 45. `server`

**Path**: `apps/backend/server/`  
**Package**: `sy-server` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Remote development and team collaboration - server mode enables Symphony as backend service.

**Role**: HTTP server mode for remote Symphony access.

**Responsibilities**:
- Run Symphony as HTTP server
- Provide WebSocket for real-time updates
- Handle authentication
- Support multiple concurrent clients
- Provide REST API
- Enable remote development

**Idea & Behavior**: Optional server mode - same backend as desktop, different frontend delivery. WebSocket for real-time collaboration. Authentication for security. Enables cloud-hosted Symphony.

### 46. `terminal`

**Path**: `apps/backend/terminal/`  
**Package**: `sy-terminal` v0.1.0

**Why We Need It**: Integrated terminal is essential IDE feature - need cross-platform PTY support.

**Role**: Cross-platform terminal/PTY integration.

**Responsibilities**:
- Provide pseudo-terminal (PTY) support
- Handle shell process spawning
- Support Windows (ConPTY) and Unix (PTY)
- Integrate with xterm.js frontend
- Handle terminal resizing
- Support multiple terminal instances

**Idea & Behavior**: Cross-platform terminal - uses crosspty for platform abstraction. Spawns native shell (PowerShell/bash/zsh). xterm.js frontend for rendering. Multiple terminals supported.
