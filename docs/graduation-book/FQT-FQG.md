# FQT and FQG Frameworks

Define Function Quest Training (FQT) and Function Quest Generation (FQG) as frameworks for skill acquisition and reusable function synthesis.

- FQT (Training): create tasks/quests, collect trajectories, score quality, update skills.
- FQG (Generation): compose reusable function graphs/templates for common development quests.
- Relation to FQM: FQM acts as the manager/registry for quests, datasets, and metrics.
- Integration: Pit artifact store, dataset versioning, quality scoring, search (Tantivy), and promotion criteria.
- Usage: in IDE (Virtuoso Mode, Vibe Coding) and in orchestrations (The Melody).
- Roadmap: metrics standardization, marketplace sharing, reproducibility.
