# UFE — User-First Extension

Define UFE as the design philosophy and mechanism that prioritizes user-owned, out-of-process extensions with safe capabilities and clear ergonomics.

- Motivation: safety, isolation, portability, and rapid iteration.
- Relation to IaE: UFE complements IaE (in-process intelligence) with user-governed out-of-process capabilities.
- Architecture: Out-of-Process path, IPC bus, capability and permissions (see Trust Verification, Permissions), lifecycle states.
- Developer Experience: carets CLI, templates, hot-reload, publishing (see Extension SDK docs).
- Comparison: UFE vs traditional plugin models.
