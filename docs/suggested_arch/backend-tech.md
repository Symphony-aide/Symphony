## Key Technology Decisions

1. **Python Conductor**: Leverage AI/ML ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
2. **Rust Infrastructure**: Performance-critical operations (The Pit)
3. **PyO3 Bridge**: Zero-copy FFI between Python and Rust
4. **IPC Bus**: Process isolation for user extensions
5. **Virtual DOM**: Backend-generated UI for React frontend

This technology stack provides:
- **AI-First Architecture** with Python RL orchestration
- **Extreme Performance** through Rust infrastructure (nanosecond operations)
- **Strategic Isolation** via dual execution models
- **Modern UI Bridge** with Virtual DOM system
- **Extensible Ecosystem** through Orchestra Kit
